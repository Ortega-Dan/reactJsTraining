    // first have no windows opened for the browser you want to debug with
    // then do the: npm start 
    // then close the browser window if opened
    // then from another console do: chromium --remote-debugging-port=9222
    // then from that window go to the url your npm start is serving ... for this example is localhost:3000
    // then set breakpoints (if not set alrady) and launch the debugging from here ...
    // then reload your browser window ... (to catch with the debugging since it was loaded before you started it)
    // and there you go ... it is debbugging (vscode debugging console should be showing something, or popping up)
